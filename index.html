            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p> Full name, Dr. Ricardo Alejandro Pedro DeRosa Garcia De la Cruz. I am first generation American, born to
                immigrant families from Mexico and Italy. I have several passions in life, one of which is learning. I
                love improving myself, and applying what I have learned especially for the benefit of those I consider
                close to me. I highly value my independence and my familial relationships. In life I have managed to
                earn a degree in medicine from the University of Guadalajara, School of Medicine, accredited through New
                York Medical College, and have practiced medicine for a brief time in Guadalajara, where some of my
                family is from, before returning to New York, where the rest of my family resides, to move on with my
                educational and professional career. I was born and raised in the boroughs of New York City, moved to
                Ohio to further my education there, lived in Gaming Austria for a year to study abroad, and then moved
                to Guadalajara for medical school. Wherever I have found myself, I thought that I could live happily,
                but in the end, wherever my family is, is where I would like to be.</p>
